TM will halt and accept any strings that belongs to the language
The trick is to avoid getting hung up on strings that will make the TM loop

W = empty set
N = 0

for i = 1 to Aleph-Naught
	s = next string in Sigma*
	W.append(s)

	TM = init a TM for s

	for each w in W
		let TM(w) move one step

		if(TM(w) halts)
			accept / reject (w)

			if(w is accepted)
				N = N + 1
				w is the N-th string of the language

			W.remove(s)
